We are excited to announce that the applications are now open for the fifth cohort of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF5).

The EPF provides a pathway for aspiring protocol contributors to make meaningful contributions to Ethereum. In each cohort, a diverse group is assembled to work toward [advancing Ethereum's technology][4] during the fellowship. This includes everything from the development of client implementations, testing and specifications, and participating in the latest core protocol research.

The program provides fellows with a unique opportunity to collaborate with other talented individuals, to engage with current Ethereum core developers and fellowship peers, and to make a significant impact on the Ethereum ecosystem.

The EPF is a permissionless program. Anyone is welcome to participate with the same access and support offered to the selected fellows. A portion of the stipend budget is allocated to rewarding active permissionless participants.

**Details**
